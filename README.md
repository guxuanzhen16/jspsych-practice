# jspsych-practice
This is a repo containing various practice experiments and other scrap tests for jspsych. Most of the experiments are replications of real studies chosen for their amusing hypotheses.

## Finished projects
* Psi Coin Manipulation (psi_rng.html)
    * Test: Does focusing on a result beforehand influence RNG generation? (Bosch, 2006)
    * Notes:
      1. Choices made in previous trials change prompts of later trials: After choosing head or tails, the trial prompts to focus on the side chosen, and compares the choice with the RNG result.
      2. Basic data analysis at the end of trials: Calculates the accuracy of the choices made and a comment that varies depending on the score.
* Reverse Memory Recall (recall.html)
   * Test: Does practicing _after_ the fact improve memory recall? (Bem, 2011)
   * Notes:
      1. How to use timeline variables in a more complex way: Takes a list of words tagged with categories and randomly selects 3 words from each category to display inseperate trials.
